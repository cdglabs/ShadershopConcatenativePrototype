Figure out how to keep links "hovered" while scrubbing a parameter
Deal with hover things appearing "under" the mouse

Scrub parameters
Transclude parameters
Make tiny graphs for parameters





Get drawing order correct

Manipulations of the apply chain
  Reorder links
  Remove links

Default values for functions
  (makes the architecture consistent)






Long term:
  Sweep, time, etc. in addition to x for parameters
  Function abstraction
  Higher-dimensional
  Different types of vis (i.e. color map = shader)
