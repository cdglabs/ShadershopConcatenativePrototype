Hacky things
  transclusion drag-drop UI uses a variable on editor
    param replacer prop - should be a param slot?
  hover implementation
  editor makes env, want a cleaner separation between editor and graphs
  separate the idea of a parameter (or result) and a view of the parameter






Exercises
  Go through a shader and figure out the best visualization for each step




Manipulations of the apply chain
  Reorder links
  Remove links


Preview added links in the add menu (create by reacting)


Animate
  Hovered link
  Every graph when you add a new link



Make tiny graphs for parameters


Styling:
  Maybe switch to stylus?
  Cursor for scrubbing parameters
  Make hover styles cleaner




Get drawing order correct



Default values for functions
  (makes the architecture consistent)


Snapping to grid for scrubbing


Pan and zoom the main graph




Long term:
  Sweep, time, etc. in addition to x for parameters
  Function abstraction
  Higher-dimensional
  Different types of vis (i.e. color map = shader)
